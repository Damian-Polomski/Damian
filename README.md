I'm Damian, hailing from South Africa. My academic journey led me to a BCom Law degree, but a newfound passion for Cybersecurity has truly captured my focus. Currently, I'm currently enrolled in the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program, honing skills like Linux | Python programming | Security Information and Event Management tools | Intrusion Detection Systems | SQL. Delving into the realm of cybersecurity not only captivates me but also fuels my drive to stay current with cutting-edge technologies and emerging threats.

Skills: Linux | Python programming | Security Information and Event Management tools | Intrusion Detection Systems | SQL.
